# Real-time-console-chat-app
 This is a simple Java real-time console program

To use this chat program, 
1. start the server first, and then 
2. 2start one or more clients and connect them to the server. 

The clients will be able to send messages to the server, which will be displayed on the server's console, and the server will send an "echo" of the message back to the client, which will be displayed on the client's console.

Note that this is just a simple example and there are many ways you could improve or extend the chat program. For example, you could add support for multiple clients, or you could add a GUI to make the chat program more user-friendly.
